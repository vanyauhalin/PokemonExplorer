# Statement of Work

Create a simple application to view pokemons.

## Minimal functionality

- List should display pokemon names from [https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon).
- List should support pagination.
- When a user clicks on cell, then the details screen is opened.
- The Pokemon details page will use the API [https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{id}/](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon) and show the next information:
  - The Pokemon's name.
  - A single image of the pokemon from the front (found under sprites).
  - The Pokemon's "types" e.g. grass.
  - The Pokemon's weight in kg.
  - The Pokemon's height in cm.
  - The page should also have some form of back button to go back to the Pokemon list.
- Make sure you consider and handle all possible states of the app (offline, data not loading, errors, etc).
- Data should be cached in the database to support offline mode.

## Requirements

- Clean Architecture / VIPER.
- Use your own design for the application.
- Code should support Unit-testing.

## Result

- Code should be pushed to a public repository on GitHub.
- Repository should contains commit history instead of a single one.
- Select icons by yourself. App should contain non-default launch icon.
- Link should be provided to interviewer.
